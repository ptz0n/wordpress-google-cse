# WordPress Google CSE Fork to handle Daily Limit Exceeded Error issue

The original project does not handle the Daily Limit Exceeded Error.  Using the gcse json api it is possible to exceed the daily limit of search queries which is 100 by default.  You can read more about that here:

https://developers.google.com/custom-search/json-api/v1/overview

The actual json that is returned when the daily limit of search queries are exceeded can be found here:

This is not another iframe embed or AJAX result listing plugin. Instead search results from your Google Custom Search Engine is served via WordPress search listing. No need to customize your theme or search box.

__You'll need to get an [Google API key](https://code.google.com/apis/console/) and a [Google Custom Search Engine ID](https://www.google.com/cse/) for it to work.__

## Dependencies

* WordPress 3.3

## Features

* Search results sorting by relevance
* Works with all post types
* Multisite &amp; network support

## Installation

1. Place the plugin (`google-cse/` directory) in the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Enter and save your [Google API](https://code.google.com/apis/console/) key and [Google Custom Search Engine](https://www.google.com/cse/) ID.
4. You're done, celebrate with a cup of coffee?

If you want to use images from the Google result in your search result (`search.php`) use `$post->cse_img` for image URL.
